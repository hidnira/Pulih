**Pulih** is a desktop application based on Java and JavaFX, designed to bridge communication between physiotherapists and patients in a remote physical rehabilitation program. The application facilitates an asynchronous workflow where a therapist can assign exercise programs, and a patient can report their progress by uploading videos for evaluation.

## Key Features 🤖
- **Dual User Roles**: Separate login systems for **Physiotherapists** and **Patients** with distinct access rights.
- **Patient Management (CRUD)**: Therapists can add, view details of, edit, and delete patient data.
- **Exercise Session Management (CRUD)**: Therapists can create, assign, edit, and delete exercise programs for each patient.
- **Patient Progress Reporting**: Patients can view their assigned tasks, upload report videos, and record their pain levels.
- **Asynchronous Evaluation**: Therapists can review report videos and provide written feedback.
- **Informative Dashboards**: A summary of statistics (total patients, reports needing review) for therapists and a progress summary for patients. [cite: 135, 249]
- **Data Visualization**: A line chart to monitor the patient's exercise adherence progress over time.
- **Local Data Storage**: All application data is stored portably in a single `database.xml` file.

## Technologies Used 💻
- **Java 11**: The primary programming language.
- **JavaFX**: The framework used for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Maven**: A build automation tool for project and dependency management.
- **XStream**: A library for serializing/deserializing Java objects to XML.
- **Scene Builder**: A visual layout tool for designing FXML interfaces.
